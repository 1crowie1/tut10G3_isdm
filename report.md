Executive Summary: Harrison

Project Objectives: Leon

Problem Definition: Abhinav

The problem faced by the travel company must be precisely defined in order to enable the development of an effective and greatly beneficial solution that meets the needs of our client’s expectations and allows them to improve their business functions. Customers having long wait times for relationship managers, or being directed to a relationship manager with whom they don’t work well with after struggling to get through the interactive voice response unit are key issues and few of many that plaque other call management centres, our system seeks to address these key issues among others. The empathy principle is a valuable tool in creating solutions that possess the functionality required by the end users, and so by putting ourselves in the shoes of the stakeholders we have identified these key issues: 

(1) The new system must be speedier and more efficient than the current one, reducing stress and preventing frustration on part of the customers and other stakeholders. This will be achieved through increasing the adaptability of the Interactive Voice Response Unit and making sure that customers of a low priority can be handed to low level RMs or other employees in the business.

(2)	The new system should simplify the operations involved with the volume and types holiday packages while developing a more detailed initial profile for relationship managers at the time of their hiring with a more detailed analysis of their characteristics and how best to use them to sell holiday packages.

(3) The new system should improve criteria used for score calculation of inbound calls by increasing complexity of tuples used for targeting list, this will be achieved through improving the criteria used for skill score calculation of RMs which will also consequently enhance the script/guideline output system quality to equip the RMs with a more effective strategy.

(4) And finally to provide for the growth of the business the new system must increase volume of information stored in database.

Advantages of System: Abhinav

Advantages of implementing the new system stretch far and wide by not only eliminating current problems faced by our client, but also through providing a substantial improvement in functionality and efficiency for achieving business objectives and facilitating daily business activities as outlined in the objectives and problem definition. The system will benefit all areas and stakeholders associated with the travel company through allowing them to carry out their intrinsic and critical business operations in a more effective manner. This provides our client with a competitive advantage and will ultimately lead to an increase in shareholder wealth.

Consequences of System Failure: Abhinav

The consequences if the new system fails can have a profound negative impact on the smooth operation of our client, this may affect anything from the relationship managers being unable to make to create new leads and contact new potential customers, or being unable to follow up and contact customers who are already in the process of making a purchasing decision. This may lead to causing the business to halt operations as the efficient functioning of the call management system centre is essential for business activities and ultimately required to enable the maximisation of shareholder wealth. The estimated impact of such a failure would be directly dependent on how heavily the system is relied upon by stakeholders such as the relationship managers for their business activities. This is also linked with how much of the system is currently implemented and in use or at what stage it is in during its implementation phase, as well as how well the contingency plans can take over or the availability of a backup system. This system is of critical importance to business function and is greatly depended on, therefore it is of equal importance and in the best interests of all shareholders to ensure the system is designed and can be incorporated in the business in a way that guarantees its rock solid reliability.
