Design Thinking Principles Approach: Harrison

This system is user focused and is targeted at providing an effecient and quick management of in coming calls. In terms of the design thinking principles, empathising with the user requires an analysis of the system from their perspective. Gathering an accurate and measureable understanding of the system from this perspective is the main barrier to the principle at hand. To do so, the use of interviewing tools in the form of client/stakeholder meetings, surveys and the like can be implemented to obtain the required information. The empathising principle requires identifying the difficult or least user friendly aspects of the current solution, i.e. the points of greatest resistance. Within the context of this system the most resistance to the system could be long wait times for RMs (relationship managers), incorrect assumptions made about a customer in the RM routing system or even difficulty interating with an Interactive Voice Response Unit when dirrected to it in a busy time.
Following on from this is the problem definition principle. Within this stage the issues with the current system that are planning to be overcome by the new system as well as the problems identified by users and stakeholders within the empathise principle are documented and analysed. These problems are broken down into their key components and the aspect of the system from which they relate to. From this a clear view of what functionalty is required by the new system is discovered. Another effective technique that can be used in conjunction with the first principle is to include user suggestions for how these problems that they have identified can be resolved, giving another perspective and depticting the functionality's issues in more detail. The RM system presents an issue in the opperation of a major travel company's call management center (CMC), how their customers are categorised and routed as well as the identification and prioritisation of potential new customers. These problems along with user feedback provide the base for the problem definition principle and are then further broken down to move into the next stage.
Ideation otherwise known as the ideate principle aims to construct solutions to the defined probelms. This involves the identfication of each core problem and works to brainstorm and provide potential options for resolutions. This stage of the design thinking processes is highly collaborative and requires all involves parties working together to create a feasable solution for each problem. For the ideation stage of the RM system all team members go through the problems outlined, inferred from the discussion topic information on the travel company's call management center. From this a plan of implementation of the most feasible solutions can be made.
Next is the principle of prototyping. Once a range of feasible solutions have been made for each of the core problems, a prototype for comparison or compatibility allows for the most beneficial solutions to be chosen for implementation with an assurance that their designed or logical functionality solves the problems at hand in a way the seemlessly interacts and does not interfere with other system functions. For the proposed CMC system, a range of logic algorithms can be simulated for prototyping purposes in a controlled environment as well as trials on existing or potential customers. This allows for solutions that may work in theory but not necessarily in practice to be identifed and replaced with solutions that work in the given contextual situation.
Finally is the testing principle phase. Once a solution has been identified and is in development testing is required to assure it meets the requirements and functions as intended before it is implemented as a live solution. In the context of the CMC system, the most effective method for implementation would be a pilotted approach. This would allow for ample live testing determine a satistfactory working system is running as well as fix any bugs that are bound to arise as the system faces its first interaction with the real everyday business processes.
