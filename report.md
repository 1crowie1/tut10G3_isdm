Advantages of System: Abhinav

Advantages of implementing the new system stretch far and wide by not only eliminating current problems faced by our client, but also through providing a substantial improvement in functionality and efficiency for achieving business objectives and facilitating daily business activities as outlined in the objectives and problem definition. The system will benefit all areas and stakeholders associated with the travel company through allowing them to carry out their intrinsic and critical business operations in a more effective manner. This provides our client with a competitive advantage and will ultimately lead to an increase in shareholder wealth.

Consequences of System Failure: Abhinav

The consequences if the new system fails can have a profound negative impact on the smooth operation of our client, this may affect anything from the relationship managers being unable to make to create new leads and contact new potential customers, or being unable to follow up and contact customers who are already in the process of making a purchasing decision. This may lead to causing the business to halt operations as the efficient functioning of the call management system centre is essential for business activities and ultimately required to enable the maximisation of shareholder wealth. The estimated impact of such a failure would be directly dependent on how heavily the system is relied upon by stakeholders such as the relationship managers for their business activities. This is also linked with how much of the system is currently implemented and in use or at what stage it is in during its implementation phase, as well as how well the contingency plans can take over or the availability of a backup system. This system is of critical importance to business function and is greatly depended on, therefore it is of equal importance and in the best interests of all shareholders to ensure the system is designed and can be incorporated in the business in a way that guarantees itâ€™s rock solid reliability.
