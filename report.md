Executive Summary: Harrison

Project Objectives: Leon
Number and types of holiday packages makes system operation difficult/complicated. A subsequent method of simplifying operations involved with the packages could be implemented

Only a 10 minute questionnaire is initally used to develop RM profiles. Taking more time to better develop an employees RM profile may increase the efficiency of skill matching.

The preloaded criteria for inbound call customers that leads to a calculated skill score and thus the priority of matching coud be an avenue of improvement.

Outbound calls are determined through a database that holds details of customers. A script is then developed by the system to improve RM service. Either increasing the volume of data that the database holds on customers or improving the script/guidlines that are developed may increase sales. 

Increasing the number of solutions the Interactive Voice Response unit can support may help filter out the customers who are prepared to make a sale, or a just asking a question.
